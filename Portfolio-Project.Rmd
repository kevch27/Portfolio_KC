## Step 1: Ask {#step-1}
#### **Soft Skills: Collaboration, Active Listening, Critical Thinking, Data Collection, etc**
<br>

#### I was approached by my colleague, a customer experience manager, who expressed curiosity about understanding the potential impact of life satisfaction on the health outcomes. He posed the following question:
>#### _"Is there a correlation between individuals' sense of life satisfaction and their health outcomes?"_

<br>

### 1a. Identify the business task {#1a}
#### My colleague's question shows a general interest to explore and uncover valuable insights in the healthcare domain, however the question was too vague and it did not specify the exact analysis or methodology.  In order to clarify the business task, I followed up by asking the following SMART questions:
<br>

#### (S)pecific:
* ##### _"Can you provide specific criteria for individuals' sense of life satisfaction?"_
* ##### _"What specific health outcomes or metrics are we interested in examining in relation to life satisfaction?"_
<br>

#### (M)easureable:
* ##### _"How can we quantify and measure individuals' sense of life satisfaction and health outcomes?"_
* ##### _"Can we establish a survey instrument to assess life satisfaction and health outcomes?"_
<br>

#### (A)ction-oriented:
* ##### _"In what ways can we tailor health insurance offerings or coverage options to better support individuals' life satisfaction and positively impact their health outcomes??"_
* ##### _"What actions can we take to raise awareness and educate individuals about the importance of life satisfaction in achieving better health outcomes?"_
<br>

#### (R)elevant:
* ##### _"In what demographic groups are we interested in studying the correlation between life satisfaction and health outcomes?"_
* ##### _"How does understanding this correlation align with the goals and priorities of our company?"_
<br>

#### (T)ime-bound:
* ##### _"Within what timeframe do we aim to complete the analysis of the correlation between life satisfaction and health outcomes?"_
* ##### _"How far back in time should we analyze the data to capture a meaningful trend?"_
<br>

### 1b. Consider key stakeholder {#1b}
<br>

#### Primary stakeholders:
* ##### Executive Management: Responsible for strategic decision-making, they utilize the correlation analysis to drive improvements in health insurance offerings and align company goals with the relationship between calmness, health outcomes, and satisfaction with healthcare services.
* ##### Product Development Manager: Utilizes correlation analysis insights to enhance health insurance products, incorporating coverage options addressing mental well-being and additional support services.
* ##### Marketing Manager: Develops targeted campaigns using correlation analysis findings to highlight the company's commitment to holistic well-being and customer satisfaction.
* ##### Data Analyst: Conducts correlation analysis, providing insights on the relationship between calmness, health outcomes, and satisfaction with healthcare services, guiding decision-making processes.
* ##### Customer Experience Manager: Utilizes correlation analysis to identify areas for improvement, ensuring a seamless and satisfactory experience that considers the impact of calmness on health outcomes and satisfaction with healthcare services. 
<br>

#### Secondary stakeholders:
* ##### Policyholders: Directly affected by the correlation between calmness, health outcomes, and satisfaction with healthcare services, potential improvements in coverage, access to care, and overall well-being support.
* ##### Customer Support Representatives: Implement improvements resulting from the correlation analysis, providing guidance on accessing mental health resources and explaining expanded coverage options to policyholders.
* ##### Claims Processing Team: Informed of changes resulting from the correlation analysis, ensuring accurate coverage assessment and seamless implementation for policyholders.
<br>

### 1c. Choose a dataset {#1c}
<br>

#### Gallup World Poll - Public Sector
>##### [Dataset Source: Global Wellbeing Initiative](https://www.gallup.com/analytics/318923/world-poll-public-datasets.aspx)
##### The Global Wellbeing Initiative (GWI) will generate an innovative research agenda aimed at improving societies, families and workplaces. This includes developing new models of wellbeing to reflect the impact of culture, community, governance and nature.


#### [**Click here to view the dataset!**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1obelPwGNgcZV46w2IHTHeK3k5GgcIibv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102598007405934795264&rtpof=true&sd=true)

<br>

### 1d. Establish metrics {#1d}
#### After engaging in a conversation with my colleague and carefully considering to his responses to the SMART questions, I assessed the data available in the dataset, resulting in the establishment of the following metrics:
* ##### Age
* ##### Calmness Index
* ##### Employment status
* ##### Job Satisfaction
* ##### Life at Peace
* ##### Gender
* ##### Health Problem Prevalence
* ##### Per capita income quintiles
* ##### Life in Balance
* ##### Urban/rural classification
<br>

### 1e. Finalize the business task to investigate {#1e}
>#### **Investigate the correlation between individuals' health problem prevalence and their sense of life satisfaction, as indicated by the calmness index, feeling at peace with life, work-life balance, and enjoyment of work.**

<br>

## Step 2: Prepare {#step-2}
#### **Skills Demonstration: Spreadsheet, SQL**
<br>

### 2a. Store Data appropriately {#2a}
#### My approach to store the dataset resonsibly involves two steps:
>#### 1. I will maintain a local copy in a dedicated folder on my computer, allowing for easy access and efficient modifications during work-in-progress.
#### 2. During milestones or significant revisions, I will upload the revised view-only file to my Google Drive account. Google Drive provides dependable cloud storage, enabling seamless sharing with stakeholders.

#### By combining the convenience of local storage with the security and accessibility of cloud storage, I ensure responsible and efficient management of the dataset file.
<br>

### 2b. Identify how it’s organized {#2b}
#### In terms of file organization, the following actions were taken:
* #### A proper file naming convention was implemented, keeping the file name short with revision number included.
* #### A logical folder structure was created with folders and subfolders to group related files.
* #### Ongoing work was separated from finalized work, with ongoing work stored on the local computer and finalized work stored on Google Drive.
* #### Regular manual backups of files were performed to prevent data loss.
<br>

### 2c. Sort and filter the data {#2c}

#### In this initial phase of data exploration, I used SQL to list top 10 ranking in the Thriving Index, Struggling Index, and Suffering Index.

<br>

##### Average Thriving Index:
```
SELECT 
  Country,
  CONCAT(CAST(AVG(Thriving_Index) * 100 AS INT64), "%") AS Average_Thriving_Index
FROM `quixotic-bonito-388417.Capstone.rev5`
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY AVG(Thriving_Index) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

![](https://i.postimg.cc/nVdN0KDG/Average-Thriving.png)

<br>

##### Average Struggling Index:
``` 
SELECT 
  Country,
  CONCAT(CAST(AVG(Struggling_Index) * 100 AS INT64), "%") AS Average_Struggling_Index
FROM `quixotic-bonito-388417.Capstone.rev5`
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Average_Struggling_Index DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
![](https://i.postimg.cc/fLyfLdRM/Average-Struggling.png)

<br>

##### Average Suffering Index:
``` 
SELECT
  Country,
  CONCAT(CAST(AVG(Suffering_Index) * 100 AS INT64), "%") AS Average_Suffering_Index
FROM portfolio_project
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY AVG(Suffering_Index) DESC;
```

### 4b. Summary of my analysis {#4b}

<br>

#### This investigation revealed weak correlations between health problems and various indicators of life satisfaction, such as recent calmness, feeling at peace with life, work-life balance, and enjoyment of work. Although the correlations are weak, it is worth mentioning that individuals who report experiencing calmness, feeling at peace, having work-life balance, and enjoying their work demonstrate a noticeable increase in their overall health, in contrast to those who do not exhibit these factors. Further analysis and exploration may be necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between health problems and life satisfaction.

### 5b. Present my findings {#5b}

<br>

* ##### Weak correlations were found between health problems and indicators of life satisfaction, including calmness, feeling at peace, work-life balance, and enjoyment of work.
* ##### Individuals experiencing calmness, peace, work-life balance, and enjoyment of work generally exhibited better overall health.
* ##### Populations residing in lower density areas, with the trend of rural > town > suburb > city, showed higher rates of health problems.
* ##### A strong correlation was identified between income perception and health problems.
* ##### The correlation between health problems and feeling at peace with life was relatively stronger compared to other indicators of life satisfaction.
* ##### Age and gender did not significantly affect the correlation between health problems and life satisfaction indicators.
* ##### Other potential factors, such as education level, marital status, or access to healthcare, should be explored to understand their influence on the relationship between health problems and life satisfaction.
* ##### Older individuals tend to have higher rates of health problems compared to younger age groups.
* ##### The correlation between work-life balance and health problems was stronger among individuals in managerial or executive positions.
* ##### Higher levels of enjoyment in work were associated with lower rates of health problems, indicating a positive impact of job satisfaction on overall health.

### 6c. Top high-level insights based on my analysis {#6c}

<br>

#### The analysis revealed several key insights regarding the correlation between health problems and life satisfaction indicators. While the correlations between health problems and factors such as calmness, feeling at peace, work-life balance, and enjoyment of work were weak, they still indicated some degree of relationship between health problems and reduced life satisfaction.

#### Individuals who reported experiencing calmness, feeling at peace, having work-life balance, and enjoying their work demonstrated better overall health, highlighting the importance of these factors in promoting well-being. Moreover, there were noticeable differences in health problems based on geographic regions, with populations in lower density areas showing higher rates of health problems. Income perception also played a significant role, as higher perceived income was associated with lower prevalence of health problems.

#### However, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between health problems and life satisfaction, further analysis and exploration are recommended. Factors such as education level, marital status, access to healthcare, and other potential influences should be investigated. Overall, the findings suggest the complex nature of the relationship between health problems and life satisfaction, emphasizing the need for in-depth exploration to inform decision-making and interventions related to well-being.
